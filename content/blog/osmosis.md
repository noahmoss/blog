***TL;DR**: If anyone can accurately explain the physical cause of osmosis to me
in a way that would be intuitive at the biological level, please contact me!

It's a common truism that a lot of the things we learn in grade school are, if
not outright lies, certainly massaged for easier consumption. Usually these
are things that I can revisit down the road and lift the curtain on rather
easily. Bohr model of the atom? Nah, probability clouds. DNA as the code for
life? Psych, let's talk about epigenetics.

But in my recent quest to refresh my knowledge of biology, which had seen its
growth stunted after a nasty brush with organic chemistry during my sophomore
year of college, I seem to have hit a wall with what I thought would be a simple
topic: osmosis. But trying to understanding osmosis---*actually* understand
it---has become a Escherian maze of contradictions with very little intuition to
be found.

As a refresher, osmosis is what happens when you have a semipermeable membrane
in a solution, with different concentrations of a solute on either side of the
membrane. "Semipermeable" means that the solvent can cross the membrane, but the
solute cannot. In biology, the membrane is usually a cell wall, the solvent is
water, and the solute is...anything else (say, sodium, or glucose). 

In this scenario, the solvent will tend to, in net, cross the membrane to
equalize the concentrations of the solute on both sides. Wikipedia has a helpful
illustration:

*Osmotic pressure* describes the pressure exerted by this flow of solvent
molecules. (Or, equivalently, the pressure that would be required to prevent
this flow---I'm envisioning someone, for example, pushing down on the right side
of the beaker.) In biology, this has far-reaching implications: osmotic pressure
keeps plant cells turgid, shrivels up slugs when they touch salt, and requires
single-celled organisms to [constantly pump out water to avoid
bursting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk5NFSvp8lY) like sailors bailing out
sinking ships.

But why does this happen?

There are a two explanations that seem to crop up in all the intro bio
textbooks:

1. Osmosis is just the net diffusion of water from an area of higher
   concentration to one of lower concentration. On the side of the membrane with
   the higher water concentration, water molecules are more likely to reach and
   pass through the membrane.
   
2. Water molecules are attracted to solvent molecules, which are typically
   charged, forming [hydration
   shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation_shell). These water molecules
   thus cannot cross the membrane.
   
Both of these explanations made a lot of sense to me, the lowly biology student!
But when I visited Wikipedia to learn more, I found:

> Both of these notions have been conclusively refuted.
