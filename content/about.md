title: "About Me"
---

I'm a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I currently work primarily in Erlang, and my professional
interests include backend development, distributed systems, and functional programming.

This website, however, is mainly the home for my personal interests. Right now these include biology (particularly
genomics and biotech), metacognition about learning and memory, and various aspects of tech policy and design.

I'll be using my blog mostly as a means of "learning in public"&mdash;clarifying and cementing concepts in my mind by
forcing myself to set them in text and put them out into the ether. My target audience is solely myself, but all the
better if others benefit from it as well.

theme.
